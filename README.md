# My Dotfiles

## Nix
Configuration for NixOS systems can be found at `nix`. The files under `nix/system` are meant to
be placed at `/etc/nixos` on a NixOS system (and probably edited first).

The files under `nix/nixpkgs` are for the Nix Home Manager.


## Configs
1. install GNU stow
2. clone this repository to somewhere in `~`
3. use `stow` to activate the configs you want. e.g. `stow tmux`
